# About The Project

This repository provides a well-structured, production-ready template for building robust and scalable Node.js serverless APIs using AWS Lambda. It leverages TypeScript for enhanced type safety and maintainability, Prisma for efficient database interactions, and AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for secure data encryption.

## Clean Code Practices:

- #### Dependency Injection (DI):

  Handlers receive dependencies (like database clients or logging services) as function parameters instead of relying on global state or singletons. This promotes cleaner code, easier testing, and improved modularity.

- #### Pure Functions:

  Handler functions are designed as pure functions: given the same inputs, they always produce the same outputs and have no side effects like modifying global state. This simplifies reasoning about their behavior and makes them more testable.

- #### TypeScript:
  Strong typing enforces data consistency, reducing runtime errors and improving code reliability. It also enhances developer experience with code completion and easier refactoring.

## Modular Design and Reusability:

- #### Dependency Folder:

  This folder houses reusable modules and utilities, promoting code reusability and separation of concerns. Developers can easily import and leverage these modules across different projects.

- #### Monolithic Architecture:

  Ideal for smaller backend projects or rapid prototyping. All functionalities reside within a single codebase for easy deployment and maintenance.

- #### Secure Data Management:

  - Prisma Integration - Simplifies database interactions with a type-safe and performant ORM (Object-Relational Mapper). It reduces boilerplate code and ensures data consistency.

  - AWS KMS Integration - Manages encryption keys centrally for secure data storage and transmission. It complies with data security best practices.

## Automated Deployment Workflow:

- #### Shell Script:
  This script automates code transpilation, build, bundling, and deployment. It prompts developers for the S3 bucket name and Lambda function name, streamline the deployment process.

# Getting Started
This section walks you through the prerequisites for development and guides you in cloning this repository, deploying your API to AWS Lambda, and customizing configurations.

## Prerequisites

  - *aws-cli*: must configure aws cli with an
  IAM user having permission to update lambda invoke lambda and interact with the s3bucket.

  - *7zip*: must install 7zip and add it's path to environment variable of your local machine.

  - *mongodb*: 
    - must create a mongodb database and include it's connection url in .env and it's encrypted value in your lambda function's environment variable as well. 
    - additionally please add db name at the end of your mongodb string for eg. `mongodb+srv://username:password@clusterName.uniqueID.mongodb.net/dbname?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=clusterName`.
    - also refer to this article before trying to connect your mongodb with lambda, [*article*](https://medium.com/@dipansh.dev.saxena/connecting-mongodb-atlas-to-aws-lambda-a-novices-tale-41ff0a5b3d8e).

  - *aws-resources*: create a lambda function from aws console and add a role to that lambda which has the policy of an kms key which will be used for encrypting and decrypting data, also create an s3 bucket for uploading your lambda code, remember their name.

  - *environment-variables*: there are 2 environment variables we have to use locally while building the code
  which is DATABASE_URL self explanatory and PRISMA_BINARY_TARGET read about it in this article [*prisma-binaries*](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/overview/generators#binary-targets)

## Installation

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://link-to-project
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd monolith-lambda-api
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

before deploying the lambda please make valid schema inside src/prisma/schema if you want work with different collection, otherwise keep everything same

Generate prisma and sync your schema with database

```bash
  npx prisma generate && npx prisma db push
```

Deploy to lambda

```bash
  npm deploy
```
